This project is created by Michael Wai Kit Tran and demostrates the AI steering behaviours: seek, flee, pursue, evade, wander, arrival, flocking, and leader following.

When first opening the program, the user is prompted with the options menu displaying several options with numbers beside them. Type down the number of the option you want to choose and press ENTER to confirm. 

Selecting an option other that exit will open a window where the selected behaviour is shown. Press BACKSPACE to return to the options menu. 

In seek an arrow which represents the agent will approach the mouse.

In flee, the agent will always move away your mouse.

In pursue, the agent will approach the point the player is heading. The player is the red arrow that follows your mouse. 

In evade, the agent will avoid the point the player is heading. 

In wander, wll agents will wander around the screen. Press the left mouse button to create an agent and press the right mouse button to delete one.

In arrival, the agent will approach the mouse and slow down until it stops at it.

In flocking, all agents will group together and follow a common direction. Agents can also be created and deleted like in wander. 

In leader following, all agents will group together and follow behind the player. Agents can also be created and deleted like in wander.
